* **`config`:** Contains configuration files for the application, including database connection settings.
* **`controllers`:** Handles logic for processing user requests and interacting with models.
* **`middleware`:**  Handles authentication and error handling.
* **`models`:** Defines database schemas for user, problem, and algorithm data.
* **`public`:** Contains static files like JavaScript, CSS, and images.
* **`routes`:**  Defines routes for the application.
* **`views`:** Contains the EJS templates for rendering different pages.
* **`app.js`:**  The main entry point for the application.

  
## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **EJS:** Templating engine for rendering dynamic content.
* **Express.js:**  Web framework for building the backend.
* **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storing application data.
* **Mongoose:**  MongoDB ODM for interacting with the database.
* **Passport.js:**  Authentication middleware for handling user login and registration.
